# vue-app

This project is created with Vue 3 in vite. On top of that, this project uses Bootstrap for styling, TypeScript, and SCSS.

This front-end application resolve around displaying a part of a collection of available Race options that D&D players
can choose when creating a player character with the 5e rule system.

## Running the application

Instructions on how to run this application you can find in the [README](../../README.md) in the root of this repository.

### Availability local private network

By using Servor, the web application is also available on your local network, and thus you can also try it out on other
devices, besides the machine you have cloned the repo to. For the available local private address that the web application
is running on, I advise you to look at the terminal output after you've run the command above to start Servor.

### Running from File Explorer (or Finder)

Because the web application makes use of the `fetch` method, opening the web application by finding the `index.html`
in your File Explorer or Finder, and opening it that way is not advisable, because that will break the application.
